#### ***Note:***

- The Streamlit dashboard is fully functional, allowing users to interact with model predictions.

## **Streamlit Pre-trained ANN Dashboard's LINK**

https://pre-trained-dlm-ann-project-bucteq7roas8k26lmu3z8z.streamlit.app/

#### ***Note:***

- The Streamlit dashboard is fully functional, but for time efficiency, the ANN model has been pre-trained and saved in .h5 format.
- This means that hyperparameter buttons in the filter pane will not change model accuracy or results since the model weights remain fixed.
- The dashboard is designed primarily for real-time predictions on different inputs, but retraining within Streamlit is not implemented to save computational resources and time.
